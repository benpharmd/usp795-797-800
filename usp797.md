# USP797

## Scope -- USP 797 applies to all persons/places who prepare Compounded Sterile Preparations (CSPs)
United States Pharmacopeia Chapter 797 (USP 797) is a set of guidelines for compounding sterile preparations, such as medications, diagnostic agents and intravenous solutions. USP 797 is intended to be used by healthcare personnel who prepare, dispense and administer compounded sterile preparations (CSPs).

USP 797 provides the minimum standards and requirements for the design and operation of clean rooms, personnel training, environmental monitoring, cleaning and disinfecting, documentation and quality assurance of CSPs, storage and handling of CSPs.

## Summary
- Must have a designated person (DP) who oversees the training program to ensure competency, and is responsible for the performance and operation of the facility and personnel compounding/using CSPs
- Risk categories are now Category 1, Category 2 and Category 3 Compounded Sterile Preparations (CSPs)
- Training for Category 1 & 2 CSPs every 6mo now; Category 3 every 3mo
- Compounding Aseptic Isolator (CAI) and Compounding Aseptic Containment Isolator (CACI) may only be used for Category 1 CSPs now. 12hr Beyond Use Dating (BUD) at room temp and 24hr BUD refrigerated. CAI and CACI in classified compounding suite may have longer BUDs
- ISO 8 environment required to have 20 Air Changes Per Hour (ACPH)
- Surface sampling for Category 1 & 2 CSPs must be completed monthly, and Category 3 sampling is weekly
- Air sampling for Category 1 & 2 CSPs must be completed every 6 months, and Category 3 sampling is monthly
- If Colony Forming Units (CFUs) outside of limit, must identify down to genus
- Primary Engineering Control (PEC) requires sterile cleaning products
- Sporicidal cleaning agents must be used monthly for Category 1 & 2 CSPs, and Weekly for Category 3 CSPs
- Master Formulations for batched products and any CSP from non-sterile components now required
- Compounding Records required
- Single Dose Vials (SDVs) may be used up to 12hr as long as storage requirements are maintained

Types of CSPs
Irrigations
- For internal body cavities (eg. bladder or peritoneal cavities), must be sterile-compounded
- Mouth, sinus and rectal cavities are not required to be sterile-compounded

## Cleanroom Area

- Pass-Thru window to general pharmacy - ISO Class 8
- Ante Room - ISO Class 7 
- Buffer Room - ISO Class 7 
- Laminar Flow Clean Bench - ISO Class 5 (eg. Baker EGB-6252)
- Biological Safety Cabinet - ISO Class 5 (eg. Baker SG603TX)

## Garbing and Hand Hygiene
### Summary 
Of note, our sink is located on the clean (far) side of the Anteroom. Below is our recommendation for donning garb. 
1. Go to the bathroom, secure hair if needed, clean personal glasses if needed
2. Remove all cosmetics
3. Remove jewelry, watch, earbuds, necklace, etc. if needed
4. Enter anteroom, and don face and head covers (beard cover if needed)
5. Don shoe covers, ensuring that covered shoes are across Line of Demarcation
6. Perform appropriate hand hygiene
7. Don gown
8. Enter the buffer room
9. Apply alcohol-based hand rub to your hands and wrists
10. Don sterile gloves

### Garbing for Category 1 & 2 CSPs
Minimum requirements and best practices for compounding Category 1 & 2 CSPs
- All garments, shoe covers, head and face coverings must be low lint
- Sterile gloves must be powder free, and must be free of holes, punctures or tears
- IPA 70% must be applied immediately prior to compounding, and regularly throughout the process
- If any garb becomes visibly soiled, replace immediately
- Donning and doffing garb should not occur at the same time and place (eg. shift change)
- Individual gowns may be reused within the same shift, if the gown remains in the Ante Room. All other garb must be replaced each time when entering the Buffer Room. 


## Cleaning

1. **Daily cleaning:** All high contact surfaces in the cleanroom, anteroom, and associated areas should be cleaned daily using a disinfectant, such as Contec’s TB1-3300, including floors, countertops, and equipment.
2. **Bi-Weekly cleaning:** Twice a week, in addition to the daily cleaning, you should perform an IPA rinse after disinfecting with TB1-3300.
3. **Weekly cleaning:** All high contact surfaces should be cleaned at least once per week with a sporidical agent. If you are compounding Category 3 CSPs, you must clean *all surfaces* with a sporicidal agent, such as Peridox RTU from Contec, at least once per week. After allowing sufficient dwell and drying time, an IPA rinse may be performed to prevent buildup and to remove streaking.
4. **Monthly cleaning:** All surfaces should be disinfected with a sporicidal agent at least once per month, if you are compounding Category 2 CSPs. An IPA rinse may be performed to prevent buildup and to remove streaking. Ensure there is no buildup of contaminants. Plant Operations should inspect and clean the filters in the HVAC system, replacing them if necessary.



## Beyond Use Dating
#### Category 1 CSPs
- Compounded in SCA
- 20-25C (room temp): 12 hour expiration
- 2-8C (refrigerator): 24 hour expiration

#### Category 2 CSPs
Must consider preparation characteristics and storage conditions. Categories now account for whether or not CSP is terminally sterilized in addition to sterility testing being performed and passed.

- Aseptically processed CSP; no sterility testing; **1 non sterile component**

| 20 to 25 C | 2 to 8 C | -25 to -10 C |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 1 day | 4 days | 45 days |

- Aseptically processed CSP; no sterility testing; **sterile components only** <-- what we do at our facility

| 20 to 25 C | 2 to 8 C | -25 to -10 C |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 4 days | 10 days | 45 days |

- Aseptically processed CSP; **sterility testing**; **sterile components only** 

| 20 to 25 C | 2 to 8 C | -25 to -10 C |
