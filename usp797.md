# USP797

## Scope -- USP 797 applies to all persons/places who prepare Compounded Sterile Preparations (CSPs)
United States Pharmacopeia Chapter 797 (USP 797) is a set of guidelines for compounding sterile preparations, such as medications, diagnostic agents and intravenous solutions. USP 797 is intended to be used by healthcare personnel who prepare, dispense and administer compounded sterile preparations (CSPs).

USP 797 provides the minimum standards and requirements for the design and operation of clean rooms, personnel training, environmental monitoring, cleaning and disinfecting, documentation and quality assurance of CSPs, storage and handling of CSPs.

## Summary
- Must have a designated person (DP) who oversees the training program to ensure competency, and is responsible for the performance and operation of the facility and personnel compounding/using CSPs
- Risk categories are now Category 1, Category 2 and Category 3 Compounded Sterile Preparations (CSPs)
- Training for Category 1 & 2 CSPs every 6mo now; Category 3 every 3mo
- Compounding Aseptic Isolator (CAI) and Compounding Aseptic Containment Isolator (CACI) may only be used for Category 1 CSPs now. 12hr Beyond Use Dating (BUD) at room temp and 24hr BUD refrigerated. CAI and CACI in classified compounding suite may have longer BUDs
- ISO 8 environment required to have 20 Air Changes Per Hour (ACPH)
- Surface sampling for Category 1 & 2 CSPs must be completed monthly, and Category 3 sampling is weekly
- Air sampling for Category 1 & 2 CSPs must be completed every 6 months, and Category 3 sampling is monthly
- If Colony Forming Units (CFUs) outside of limit, must identify down to genus
- Primary Engineering Control (PEC) requires sterile cleaning products
- Sporicidal cleaning agents must be used monthly for Category 1 & 2 CSPs, and Weekly for Category 3 CSPs
- Master Formulations for batched products and any CSP from non-sterile components now required
- Compounding Records required
- Single Dose Vials (SDVs) may be used up to 12hr as long as storage requirements are maintained

Types of CSPs
Irrigations
- For internal body cavities (eg. bladder or peritoneal cavities), must be sterile-compounded
- Mouth, sinus and rectal cavities are not required to be sterile-compounded

## Cleanroom Area

- Ante Room (Pass-Thru to general pharmacy) - ISO Class 8
- Buffer Room - ISO Class 7 
- Laminar Flow Clean Bench - ISO Class 5 (eg. Baker EGB-6252)
- Biological Safety Cabinet - ISO Class 5 (eg. Baker SG603TX)

## Garbing and Hand Hygiene
Of note, our sink is located on the clean (far) side of the Anteroom. Below is our recommendation for donning garb. 
1. Go to the bathroom, secure hair if needed, clean personal glasses if needed
2. Remove all cosmetics
3. Remove jewelry, watch, earbuds, necklace, etc. if needed
4. Enter anteroom, and don face and head covers (beard cover if needed)
5. Don shoe covers, ensuring that covered shoes are across Line of Demarcation
6. Perform appropriate hand hygiene
7. Don gown
8. Enter the buffer room
9. Apply alcohol-based hand rub to your hands and wrists
10. Don sterile gloves


## Cleaning

1. **Daily cleaning:** All high contact surfaces in the cleanroom, anteroom, and associated areas should be cleaned daily using a disinfectant, such as Contecâ€™s TB1-3300, including floors, countertops, and equipment.
2. **Bi-Weekly cleaning:** Twice a week, in addition to the daily cleaning, you should perform an IPA rinse after disinfecting with TB1-3300.
3. **Weekly cleaning:** All high contact surfaces should be cleaned at least once per week with a sporidical agent. If you are compounding Category 3 CSPs, you must clean *all surfaces* with a sporicidal agent, such as Peridox RTU from Contec, at least once per week. After allowing sufficient dwell and drying time, an IPA rinse may be performed to prevent buildup and to remove streaking.
4. **Monthly cleaning:** All surfaces should be disinfected with a sporicidal agent at least once per month, if you are compounding Category 2 CSPs. An IPA rinse may be performed to prevent buildup and to remove streaking. Ensure there is no buildup of contaminants. Plant Operations should inspect and clean the filters in the HVAC system, replacing them if necessary.



## Beyond Use Dating
Category 1 CSPs
- Compounded in SCA
- 20-25C (room temp): 12 hour expiration
- 2-8C (refrigerator): 24 hour expiration

Category 2 CSPs
Must consider preparation characteristics and storage conditions
| Category 2 CSPs | Beyond Use Dating |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Preparation characteristics | Storage conditions |
| Compounding method | Sterility Testing Passed | 20-25C | 2-8C | -25 to -10C |
