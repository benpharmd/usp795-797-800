## Scope -- USP 797 applies to all persons/places who prepare Compounded Sterile Preparations (CSPs)
United States Pharmacopeia Chapter 797 (USP 797) is a set of guidelines for compounding sterile preparations, such as medications, diagnostic agents and intravenous solutions. USP 797 is intended to be used by healthcare personnel who prepare, dispense and administer compounded sterile preparations (CSPs).

USP 797 provides the minimum standards and requirements for the design and operation of clean rooms, personnel training, environmental monitoring, cleaning and disinfecting, documentation and quality assurance of CSPs, storage and handling of CSPs.

## Summary
- Must have a designated person (DP) who oversees the training program to ensure competency, and is responsible for the performance and operation of the facility and personnel compounding/using CSPs
- Risk categories are now Category 1, Category 2 and Category 3 Compounded Sterile Preparations (CSPs)
- Training for Category 1 & 2 CSPs every 6mo now; Category 3 every 3mo
- Compounding Aseptic Isolator (CAI) and Compounding Aseptic Containment Isolator (CACI) may only be used for Category 1 CSPs now. 12hr Beyond Use Dating (BUD) at room temp and 24hr BUD refrigerated. CAI and CACI in classified compounding suite may have longer BUDs
- ISO 8 environment required to have 20 Air Changes Per Hour (ACPH)
- Surface sampling for Category 1 & 2 CSPs must be completed monthly, and Category 3 sampling is weekly
- Air sampling for Category 1 & 2 CSPs must be completed every 6 months, and Category 3 sampling is monthly
- If Colony Forming Units (CFUs) outside of limit, must identify down to genus
- Primary Engineering Control (PEC) requires sterile cleaning products
- Sporicidal cleaning agents must be used monthly for Category 1 & 2 CSPs, and Weekly for Category 3 CSPs
- Master Formulations for batched products and any CSP from non-sterile components now required
- Compounding Records required
- Single Dose Vials (SDVs) may be used up to 12hr as long as storage requirements are maintained

Types of CSPs
