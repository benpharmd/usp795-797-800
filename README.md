- Minimum cleaning schedule must be clearly stated
- Evaluate whether or not your facility needs a powder containment hood
- Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) must be from FDA registered facility
- Spill kits --> must have policy and training in place
- Master Formulations
- Compound Records
- Quality Assurance and Quality Control are more robust, including compliant and adverse event investigations

### Scope -- USP 795 applies to all persons/places who prepare Compounded Non-Sterile Preparations (CNSPs)
Designated Person (DP) oversees
- Training program to ensure competency 
- Selects components

- Establish, document and monitor procedures for handling and storage of CNSPs and their components
- Ensures that Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are fully implemented
- DP must be identified in facility's SOPs

### Training
Must have initial training, a refresher every 12 months, and ongoing monitoring (overseen by DP)
Core Competencies include
- Hand hygiene
- Garbing
- Cleaning and sanitizing 
- Handling/transporting of CNSPs
- Measuring and mixing
- Proper use of equipment/devices used with CNSPs
- Documentation of compounding --> Master Formulation and Compounding Records
- Knowledge and understanding of USP 795

- Reads and understands procedures related to compounding duties
- Personnel demonstrates compentency after being guided throughout the process of compounding CNSPs, afterwhich they may compound without direct supervision
- Records of competencies must be kept on site

### Hygiene and Garbing
Notify DP of potential contaminations which include rashes, recent tattoos, oozing sores, conjuctivitis, active respiratory infection. DP will make determination if personnel may compound

- Use alcohol-based hand rub or replace before compounding a CNSP with different components
- Must replace gloves if holes/punctures/tears are detected

## USP797

### Scope -- USP 797 applies to all persons/places who prepare Compounded Sterile Preparations (CSPs)
United States Pharmacopeia Chapter 797 (USP 797) is a set of guidelines for compounding sterile preparations, such as medications, diagnostic agents and intravenous solutions. USP 797 is intended to be used by healthcare personnel who prepare, dispense and administer compounded sterile preparations (CSPs).

USP 797 provides the minimum standards and requirements for the design and operation of clean rooms, personnel training, environmental monitoring, cleaning and disinfecting, documentation and quality assurance of CSPs, storage and handling of CSPs.

### Summary
- Must have a designated person (DP) who oversees the training program to ensure competency, and is responsible for the performance and operation of the facility and personnel compounding/using CSPs
- Risk categories are now Category 1, Category 2 and Category 3 Compounded Sterile Preparations (CSPs)
- Training for Category 1 & 2 CSPs every 6mo now; Category 3 every 3mo
- Compounding Aseptic Isolator (CAI) and Compounding Aseptic Containment Isolator (CACI) may only be used for Category 1 CSPs now. 12hr Beyond Use Dating (BUD) at room temp and 24hr BUD refrigerated. CAI and CACI in classified compounding suite may have longer BUDs
- ISO 8 environment required to have 20 Air Changes Per Hour (ACPH)
- Surface sampling for Category 1 & 2 CSPs must be completed monthly, and Category 3 sampling is weekly
- Air sampling for Category 1 & 2 CSPs must be completed every 6 months, and Category 3 sampling is monthly
- If Colony Forming Units (CFUs) outside of limit, must identify down to genus
- Primary Engineering Control (PEC) requires sterile cleaning products
- Sporicidal cleaning agents must be used monthly for Category 1 & 2 CSPs, and Weekly for Category 3 CSPs
- Master Formulations for batched products and any CSP from non-sterile components now required
- Compounding Records required
- Single Dose Vials (SDVs) may be used up to 12hr as long as storage requirements are maintained

Types of CSPs
Irrigations
- For internal body cavities (eg. bladder or peritoneal cavities), must be sterile-compounded
- Mouth, sinus and rectal cavities are not required to be sterile-compounded

### Beyond Use Dating
Category 1 CSPs
- Compounded in SCA
- 20-25C (room temp): 12 hour expiration
- 2-8C (refrigerator): 24 hour expiration

Category 2 CSPs
Must consider preparation characteristics and storage conditions
| Category 2 CSPs | Beyond Use Dating |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Preparation characteristics | Storage conditions |
| Compounding method | Sterility Testing Passed | 20-25C | 2-8C | -25 to -10C |
